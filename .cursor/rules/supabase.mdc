### Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.
- Use dedicated `*.service.ts` data services for communication in Angular components (implement them when necessary), rather than directly using `@supabase/supabase-js`.
